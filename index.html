                <h3>Summary</h3>
                    
                    <ul>

                    <li><h4>Musician</h4></li>
                        <p>I am a classically trained musician with more than 17 years of experience on the trumpet.
                           I have performed with many skilled groups including the Friends University Jazz Ensemble 2,
                           the Fort Hays State University Jazz Ensemble 1, and as part of the latter group, was able
                           to perform in many places like KMEA (the Kansas Music Educators Association) conference and 
                           before a Dallas Winds Symphony concert in which Eric Whitacre was conducting the DWS.       
                        </p>

                    <li><h4>Digital Artist</h4></li>
                        <p>I have taught myself how to draw my whole life, but the last 5 years I have really jumped into
                           it more than ever. I use primarily the iPad for my art where I've learned ProCreate, Clip Studio Paint,
                           and more recently, Adobe Fresco. A link to my work is listed below.

                    <li><h4>Web Developer</h4></li>
                        <p>Web Developing is a more recent interest of mine. I havea  very analytical mind and after taking a 
                           Linux Fundamentals course through my job, I've decided to pursue this more. Web developing suits me 
                           because I can be very creative with my work, while building something technical that results in great
                           satisifaction.
